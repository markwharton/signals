Generate a changelog release using pk.

Run this on a development branch, not on a guarded branch (e.g., main).

First, preview with a dry run:

pk changelog --dry-run

Show the preview to the user and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
If confirmed, run:

pk changelog

The commit carries a Release-Tag trailer; no git tag is created yet.

Report the result to the user. Follow with `/release` to tag, merge, and push.
