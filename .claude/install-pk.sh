# install-pk.sh — bootstraps the pk binary for Claude Code sessions.
#
# Managed by `pk setup`. Regenerated on every setup run and removed on
# `pk teardown`. Don't edit this file — customizations will be overwritten.
#
# When it runs:
# - Configured as a SessionStart hook, so Claude Code invokes it at the
#   start of every session.
#
# What it does:
# - On a developer machine with pk already on PATH: exits immediately.
#   The body of this script never runs locally.
# - In a Claude Code cloud sandbox (ephemeral VM with no pk installed):
#   downloads the matching pk release into $HOME/.local/bin so the
#   protective hooks (pk guard, pk preserve, pk protect) can run.
